# Osiris: Raw Ripper
A raw ripping software dedicated to the Raw Providers and of course, readers who want full access to manga/manhua/manhwa chapter releases at the palm of their hands without having to go through so much hassle.

This is a project with some codes loosely based around other projects related.

This project is mainly based on riderkick's work: https://github.com/riderkick/FMD
However, this project would be dedicated mainly for assisting Scanlators: Raw Providers of the Scans Community, and some aggregators who seek to make use of this.
